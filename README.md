Procedural Locomotion
=====================

Automating human walk cycles using machine learning (work in progress)

![example](img/anim-viewer.png)

Notes
-----

To view the trained locomotion, do:

`cd src`
`python AnimationViewer.py`

Notes on training the model will be added in the future.

This is a work in progress project. It uses data extracted by the [animation editor project](https://github.com/hmoraldo/AnimationEditor).
